Hi, My name is Miguel Antonio D. Chavez.
I'm in my 4th year of my computer science degree. Between July and September of this year, I've rendered 300 of 350 required hours of my web development internship. There, I learned some full stack development with the XAMPP tech stack. I study in the Computer Science course of De La Salle Dasmari√±as.
I like watching dream-like films and anime. Some of my recent favorites include Paprika, Birdman, and Midsommar. Currently, my favorite band is Oh! Flamingo as I love indie-opm. As a hobby, I try to stay consistent with exercise and martial arts. As a 4th year student I'm equal parts scared and excited for the year to come.
