Hi, My name is Miguel Antonio D. Chavez.
I'm in my 4th year of my computer science degree. Between July and September of this year, I've rendered 300 of 350 required hours of my web development internship. There, I learned some full stack development with the XAMPP tech stack. I study in the Computer Science course of De La Salle Dasmari√±as.
